# UBCStudyBot

UBCStudyBot is an innovative web application designed to help students at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and beyond find personalized study techniques based on their academic needs. This AI-powered chatbot leverages machine learning to recommend effective study strategies, ensuring that students can maximize their productivity and focus. 

The chatbot analyzes the user's preferences, such as their study habits, the subject they are studying, and their available time, and then suggests the most effective study techniques tailored to their needs. The app uses the latest advancements in natural language processing and machine learning models to ensure the recommendations are dynamic and constantly improving.

In addition to the study technique recommendations, the app incorporates location-based services using OpenRoute's PHI 4 API. This allows students to find the best study spots and routes on the UBC campus, ensuring that they are always close to the most conducive environments for studying. Whether it's a quiet corner in the library or a secluded spot outdoors, UBCStudyBot helps students navigate campus with ease.

### Key Features:
- **Personalized Study Technique Recommendations**: Get tailored study techniques based on your learning style, the subject you are studying, and how much time you have.
